# NodeJS Training Project

Before starting, make sure to create a clean branch and work off that.

## Tasks to be completed
1. Add route to the routing js file that will accept an input and return an output
2. Update the bin/www js file to use the latest JS syntax
    * instead of `var` use the keywords let or const where appropriate
    * update the functions to use the arrow function syntax instead of the keyword `function`
3. Create a js page that will act as a module which will be used when accessing the custom route
    * This page will be some type of function that will perform an action
    * The function could return a modified string, calculation output, etc.
4. Create a second Node App in the project folder
    * Create 2 folders, one for the original app and another for the second app
    * Move the original app into its new folder and do the same for the second app and it's folder
    * Keep in mind both apps cannot be using the same port number
5. Implement communication between the 2 apps based on certain user inputs
6. Implement logging of all actions performed by both Node Servers
